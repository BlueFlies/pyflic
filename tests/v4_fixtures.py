"""Simulated DFM firmware 4.0.0 recordings for tests (generation 3).

A per-millisecond simulation of the Paradigm rules in DFMV3_V2's
``src/LEDControl.c``, writing what PyMCU 4.0.0 writes from them: the 90-column
``DFM<id>_<n>.csv`` files (``StatusPacket.py``, ``DFM.py``, ``DFMGroup.py``),
the ``Program.txt`` export (``Program.py``, ``InstructionSet.py``,
``Instruction.py``, ``Paradigm.py``) and ``Messages.csv`` (``MessagesList.py``,
``Message.py``).  ``LEDControl.c`` is the authority: where this module and it
disagree, it is right, and ``test_ledcontrol_crosscheck.py`` compiles it and
compares the two millisecond by millisecond.  Every later stream of the
firmware 4.0.0 work (``docs/v4-data-plan.md``, Phase 0a) builds its test data
here, so the public names below are a contract.

How a recording is made, per DFM:

* **Signals.**  Each Well's signal is built as a 1 ms array: a resting level,
  plus optional :class:`Ramp` drift, plus Gaussian noise drawn every
  ``noise_step_ms`` and interpolated (noise that changes every millisecond
  would make a Well near its threshold flicker faster than the Event gap and
  so look like one endless bout), plus the scripted :class:`Bout` amplitudes.
  The firmware compares the sum of 128 scans with ``threshold * 128``, so the
  array is held as that integer sum and the comparison is the firmware's,
  exactly.  The 128-scan smoothing itself is not simulated.
* **Baseline.**  PyMCU's truncating running mean of each Well's first ten
  ``W`` values (``DFM.UpdateBaseline``), added to the authored thresholds
  when ``baseline`` is true.  ``Program.txt`` prints the thresholds raw, as
  PyMCU does when it writes the file at the start of the recording.
* **Schedule.**  PyMCU's ``GetPosition``: the first instruction reaches the
  DFM after ``lead_in_records`` records (PyMCU waits for the baseline), and a
  new one at every change of Interval or Cycle, flagged keep-state when it
  names the Paradigm last sent.
* **Engine.**  Each Well's state machine is ``StepWell`` transcribed, run
  event-driven: one exact step wherever something can change (a contact
  change, a timer running out, an instruction), and the quiet stretches in
  between applied in one go.  ``simulate(spec, _step_every_ms=True)`` runs
  every millisecond instead, which the tests use to check the shortcut.
* **Records.**  Record ``n`` (``Index`` n) holds steps ``(n-1)*200`` to
  ``n*200 - 1`` and is stamped ``start + n * 0.2 s``; ``OnMs`` counts its lit
  steps after Linkage, ``OptoCol1`` and the Paradigm state are read after
  its last step, and ``W`` is that step's sum shifted right by 7, as
  ``AnalogInputs.c`` does.  The lead-in rows' ``Paradigm`` is ``NA``: PyMCU
  has no instruction to name before the program (``StatusPacket``).
* **Restarts** (:class:`Restart`, PyMCU 529b926's ``DFM._StartRestart`` and
  ``_FinishRestart``).  The DFM goes down at a record boundary and writes no
  records while it is down, so ``Index`` jumps; it boots under the idle
  instruction, every Well Off, whose rows PyMCU writes with ``Interval``,
  ``Cycle`` and ``Paradigm`` ``NA``; then PyMCU sends the instruction in
  force again without keep-state, so every Well starts as under a new
  Paradigm.  ``Activations`` carries on, as PyMCU carries it.  The firmware
  has no part in a restart, so ``firmware_inputs`` refuses a DFM with one.
* **Faults** (:func:`write_v4_recording`): a ``Program.txt`` that is not the
  program that ran (``program_paradigms``) and a misreported LED
  (:class:`OnMsFault`).  They change the files only, never the truth.

Times in :class:`SimTruth` are 1 ms steps from the start of the recording; the
record holding step ``t`` has ``Index`` ``t // 200 + 1``.
