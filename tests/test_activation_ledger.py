"""The Activation ledger (``pyflic/base/activation_ledger.py``) against the simulator's truth.

Contract C3 of ``docs/paradigm-analyses-plan.md``: on every simulator spec,
every Activation whose light period is its own (not ``Overlap``) and timed
to the millisecond (``Timing`` exact) has the truth's onset, end and lit
time, from the Well's own output before Linkage (``SimTruth.lit_spans_ms``);
``K``, ``Phase`` and ``RequirementMet`` are the truth's too.  The rules for
``Overlap``, ``Boundary`` and ``Timing`` are then shown one by one, on small
hand-made states and on the specs built for them (``family_specs``).
