# Analysing FLIC Data: Options from the Pletcher Laboratory

*For users of the FLIC (Fly Liquid-food Interaction Counter) system · October 2026*

The FLIC system records each fly's contact with food: the Drosophila Feeding
Monitors (DFMs) measure the signal from every feeding well, and the MCU,
running PyMCU, saves those signals as data files. Turning the files into
feeding measures, figures and statistics takes analysis software. The
Pletcher Laboratory offers two packages for this. Both are available at no
cost from the laboratory's GitHub page:

- **FLIC R Code**, the laboratory's original analysis code, written in R.
- **pyflic**, its successor, a Python application with a graphical interface.

**We recommend pyflic for all new work**, and we encourage laboratories that
use the R code to move to it.

## Option 1: FLIC R Code

The R code is the analysis the laboratory has used for many years. It counts
the fly's interactions with food (licks and feeding events) in single-well
and two-well choice experiments, and computes summaries and preference
indices from them.

**Where to get it:** <https://github.com/PletcherLab/FLIC_R_Code>. You will
need R, RStudio and the R packages *ggplot2*, *reshape2* and *gridExtra*. The
repository's Readme explains the setup, and its three example documents
(*GettingStarted*, *GroupedAnalysis* and *ChoiceChamberAnalysis*) walk through
typical analyses with example data. The code is released under the MIT
licence.

**What to expect:** the R code has no graphical interface. Every step,
including loading data, checking quality, describing the experimental design
and drawing figures, is a line of R that you write and maintain. It suits
users who are comfortable in R, but it becomes unwieldy as experiments grow
larger or more numerous.

## Option 2: pyflic (recommended)

pyflic is the laboratory's Python successor to the R code. It uses the same
method for finding feeding in the signal, with the same parameters, and it is
designed to reproduce the R code's results. Around that core it adds a
graphical interface, built-in quality control, pooled analysis of several
experiments, and automatic reports.

**Where to get it:** <https://github.com/PletcherLab/pyflic>. The *Getting
Started* guide
(<https://github.com/PletcherLab/pyflic/blob/main/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md>)
assumes no experience with Python or the command line and takes about 15
minutes. A free tool called *uv* installs Python and everything pyflic needs,
kept apart from anything else on the computer. pyflic runs on Windows, macOS
and Linux, and needs no network connection, database or server.

### Why move to pyflic

- **No programming required.** An experiment is described once in a form, and
  analyses run from checkboxes and a single button.
- **Problems are caught before they reach your results.** pyflic checks every
  recording for gaps, drifting signals, interference between the two wells of
  a choice chamber and chambers that should be excluded, and shows you the
  evidence.
- **It scales.** Several related experiments can be pooled into one
  *Project* with combined statistics, and a whole folder of Projects can run
  unattended.
- **Results are reproducible.** Every setting is saved in a readable text file
  beside the data, and each report lists the parameters it used.
- **Moving over is straightforward.** The parameters are those of the R code
  (`Feeding.Threshold` becomes `feeding_threshold`), and the pyflic README
  includes a table matching R functions to their pyflic equivalents.
- **It is where development happens.** New analyses, and support for new
  versions of the FLIC hardware and software, are being added to pyflic.

### Features

- **Analysis Hub:** one window to load data, run quality control, analyse and
  plot, with an editor for setting up each experiment and its treatments.
- **Feeding and tasting detection:** licks, feeding events, tasting, bout
  durations, intervals between bouts, and preference indices for two-well
  choice experiments.
- **Quality control:** a data-integrity report, a QC Viewer that shows the raw
  signal beside the feeding pyflic detected, checks for interference between
  wells, and exclusion rules that record why each chamber was left out.
- **Assay types:** ready-made analyses for Hedonic feeding and Progressive
  Ratio (including the breaking point), a general-purpose type, and an editor
  in which a laboratory can define its own assay types without writing code.
- **Optogenetics:** a light QC that compares when each LED was on with when
  the fly was actually feeding, and flags light that ran with no feeding
  behind it (usually a sign of a sensor problem rather than fly behaviour).
- **Statistics:** ANOVA and linear mixed models, bootstrap confidence
  intervals, parameter sensitivity analyses and the fine structure of
  feeding bouts. Pooled Projects add a mixed model with DFM nested within
  experiment.
- **Figures and reports:** journal-ready vector figures from a Plot Editor,
  and PDF reports for each experiment and each Project covering quality
  control, results, statistics and the settings used.
- **Automation:** saved analysis scripts that rerun identically, and batch
  runs across many Projects.
- **Built-in help:** press F1 or a `?` button anywhere for the relevant topic;
  every detection parameter links to an explanation of what it does.
- **Optional extras:** a Python library for use in Jupyter notebooks, and an
  optional AI-written summary of a Project's results.

### Features that need version 4.0.0 of PyMCU and the DFM firmware

pyflic analyses recordings from current FLIC systems today. The features
below use the extra information recorded by **version 4.0.0 of PyMCU and the
DFM firmware, which will be released in the first quarter of 2027**. Both the
MCU and the DFMs must be updated to version 4.0.0 to use them.

- **Exact light timing:** how long each well's LED was on, to the millisecond,
  in place of samples taken five times a second.
- **Light programs recorded with the data:** each data row records which step
  of the light program, and which rule (*Paradigm*), was in force, so results
  can be split by program step.
- **Each fly's progress through the program:** its Acclimation period, the
  light periods it earned, and, in ratio assays, its current requirement and
  progress toward it. The end of Progressive Ratio training is read directly
  from these records.
- **Rule checks:** a check that each Paradigm behaved as programmed, so that
  you know the flies experienced the light schedule you intended.

**The FLIC R Code will not support the new features of version 4.0.0.**
These will include:

- **Light rules named explicitly:** each rule (*Paradigm*) is written by
  name, with its own settings, in a plain-text Program file, where older
  firmware inferred the rule from combinations of settings. Six are
  available: Open Loop, Closed Loop, Fixed Interval, Non-Feeding, Progressive
  Ratio and Fixed Ratio.
- **New ratio assays:** Fixed Ratio lights the LED on every *n*-th feeding
  bout, and Progressive Ratio now counts separate feeding bouts and can
  follow an arithmetic or an exponential series.
- **Acclimation:** Fixed Interval and the ratio rules can start with a set
  number of closed-loop light activations, counted for each well, so every
  fly receives exactly the same number before the main rule begins.
- **Consistent feeding bouts:** a fly that dips in and out of the food within
  a set gap counts as making one bout.
- **Progress that carries over:** a well keeps its place in a rule when the
  next program step uses the same rule, so thresholds can change in the
  middle of an experiment without restarting a progressive ratio.
- **A full record of the light:** every 200 ms, the data file records the
  program step, cycle and Paradigm in force and, for each well, its phase
  (Acclimation or main), its light activations, its ratio requirement and
  progress, and its LED on-time to the millisecond.

To analyse experiments that use these features, use pyflic.
