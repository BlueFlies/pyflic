# Config Editor

```bash
pyflic config
```

A form-based editor for `flic_config.yaml`. It knows which keys exist, which values are
allowed, and which are required, so it writes a valid configuration rather than leaving you
to discover a typo three steps later.

Use it for your first configuration. Hand-editing YAML is fine once you know the format —
see [Configuration file structure](config-structure.md) — but there is no advantage to
starting there.

**F1**, or the editor's **Help** menu, opens this topic; every card carries a `?` for its
own section, and every detection parameter a `?` that opens
[Parameter reference](reference-parameters.md) at that parameter, so you can read what a
value does without leaving the form. **File → Script Editor…** (Ctrl+E), or the scripts
button in the top bar, opens the [Script Editor](scripts-editor.md) on the saved file.

## The two tabs

**Experiment** — everything that applies to the recording as a whole: the Experiment
Type, the Chamber Layout it implies, well names, the detection parameters, and the factors
of your design.

**DFMs & Chambers** — one tab down the left side per device, each with its own chamber
assignments and parameter overrides. **Add DFM** and **Remove DFM** sit below the list;
Remove acts on the DFM you have selected and names it before it discards anything.

**Problems are counted on the tab they live on.** A ⚠ and a number on a tab label means
something there needs attention — a Hedonic experiment with no well names, a chamber
missing a factor level. Saving with problems outstanding is allowed; the editor lists them
first so you are choosing to.

## The Experiment tab

### Experiment Settings

- **Experiment Type** — the assay; its `?` opens
  [Experiment types](concepts-experiment-types.md). **The Experiment Type owns the Chamber
  Layout.** Choose *Hedonic Feeding* or *Progressive Ratio* and the layout is fixed for you
  — shown, but not editable, because those assays are two-well by definition. A **Custom
  Experiment**, or a lab type that leaves the layout open, chooses its own. Your lab's own
  types are listed with *(lab)* after them, and **New type…** opens the
  [Experiment Type Editor](app-type-editor.md); saving a config whose type is one of your
  lab's writes the type beside it as `experiment_type.yaml`.
- **Chamber Layout** — single-well gives 12 chambers per DFM; two-well gives 6. Change the
  layout and the chamber fields on the other tab change with it — and if that would discard
  assignments you have already made, the editor names them and asks first. The editor
  writes `experiment_type:` for any type but Custom, `chamber_layout:` when the type leaves
  the layout open, and `params.chamber_size` for neither: it is derived from the layout,
  never stored.
- **Well A** and **Well B** — the names of the two wells, for a two-well layout.
- **Transform Licks** — the 0.25-power transform of lick counts; see
  [The lick transform](concepts-metrics.md#the-lick-transform).
- **Control Level** — shown for a type with a Treatment control: the level of its control
  factor that every other level is compared with. See
  [Control comparisons](concepts-experiment-types.md#control-comparisons).
- **Optogenetics** — `auto`, `yes` or `no`: whether the optogenetic light QC runs. Each
  DFM tab has its own picker, which inherits unless you pick. See
  [`global.optogenetics`](config-structure.md#globaloptogenetics).
- **Facet source** — where the Facets come from: minute cutoffs (the default), or the
  Program Intervals of `Program.txt`, with or without their Cycles pooled. A type that
  owns its Facets, such as Progressive Ratio, greys it out. See
  [Program Facets](concepts-facets.md#program-facets).

### Auto-filter thresholds

Each of **Min Untransformed Licks**, **Max Median Duration** and **Max Events** has a
**Use** checkbox and a value field:

- Uncheck **Use** to turn that filter off. The editor writes YAML `null`, so a typed
  experiment does not fall back to its default.
- Check **Use** and leave the value blank to keep the Experiment Type's default, shown as
  grey placeholder text.
- Check **Use** and type a number to override it.

A Custom Experiment has no defaults, so there the filter runs only when **Use** is checked
and a number is typed. What each cutoff removes is in
[Automatic exclusion](config-dfms-chambers.md#automatic-exclusion).

### Progressive Ratio settings

For a type with the Progressive Ratio module, a *Progressive Ratio* section below the
thresholds holds the module's own constants: whether a chamber group whose training never
completed, or whose light QC failed, leaves the analysis; the light QC's thresholds; and
the breaking point's **Break gap** (`pr_break_gap_min`) and **Test window cap**
(`pr_test_window_min`). They follow the thresholds' rule. A blank field shows the type's
default as grey text and keeps it, and a switch left on *default* does the same; only a
value you type or pick is written under `global.constants`. A value out of range, such as
a gap of 0, is counted on the tab and listed before saving, and pyflic refuses to load a
config that states one. What each setting does is in
[the light QC](concepts-progressive-ratio.md#light-qc) and
[the breaking point](concepts-progressive-ratio.md#breaking-point).

### Optogenetic light QC settings

Once the experiment is known to be optogenetic — **Optogenetics** is `yes`, or it is `auto`
and `data/` holds a `Program.txt` or a run has already written its light QC — an
*Optogenetic light QC* section shows the thresholds, shared by every type, under the same
rule as the rest: grey defaults, and only what you type is written. Thirteen of them apply
to firmware 4.0.0 recordings only, eight of those to the checks of each Paradigm's own
rule. See [Optogenetic experiments](concepts-optogenetics.md#thresholds).

### Global Parameters

The detection parameters, applied to every DFM unless a DFM tab overrides them. Each has a
`?` for its entry in [Parameter reference](reference-parameters.md). **The editor writes
canonical parameter names.** Older aliases such as `link_gap` and `tasting_low` are still
accepted when read, but what gets written is the canonical name.

### Experimental Design Factors

Optional. Declaring a factor here gives the chamber table on the other tab one column per
factor, each a dropdown of that factor's levels, which is the main reason to use the editor
rather than hand editing: adding a factor by hand means rewriting every chamber assignment
in the file. See [Factorial designs](config-factors.md).

## The DFMs & Chambers tab

### DFM Identity

The DFM's id — the number in its data file names — and its own **Optogenetics** picker:
*inherit* takes the Experiment tab's setting; `auto`, `yes` or `no` decide for this DFM
alone, because whether a lid was lit is a fact about the recording. See
[Optogenetics per DFM](config-dfms-chambers.md#optogenetics-per-dfm).

### Chamber assignments

The **Chamber → Treatment Assignments** table, one row per chamber. Leave a Treatment cell
blank to omit that chamber from the config. With factors declared, the table has a column
per factor instead, each a dropdown of its levels.

**Factor assignments are positional and must be complete.** With two factors declared,
every assigned chamber needs a level in both columns — the columns are read in declaration
order, so a half-filled row is an incomplete assignment, not a shorter one. The editor
marks the gap and leaves that chamber out of the file rather than writing something that
would read back wrong. See [How chambers map to wells](config-dfms-chambers.md#how-chambers-map-to-wells).

### Paired chamber per chamber group

With a type that has the Progressive Ratio module, each DFM tab shows **Paired chamber per
chamber group**, with a **Groups** choice:

- **Pairs**: one picker per pair (1+2, 3+4, 5+6) naming its paired chamber, written as
  `paired_chambers:`. The other chamber is yoked and never written. Give both chambers of
  a pair the same treatment.
- **Single chambers**: every chamber its own group, with no yoked control, written as
  `chamber_groups: single`. The pickers are greyed out.
- **From Program.txt**: neither key is written, and the loader takes the groups from the
  linkage of the `Program.txt` in `data/`. Without one, the DFM does not load.

A DFM entry that already names neither key opens on *From Program.txt*. Set **PI
Direction** on the DFM to the side the sucrose well (well A) is on. See
[Progressive Ratio experiments](concepts-progressive-ratio.md#chamber-groups-paired-and-yoked).

### Parameter Overrides

Tick a parameter's box to override the global value for this DFM alone; an unticked one
inherits. Per-DFM overrides are how counterbalancing is set up; see
[`pi_direction`](reference-parameters.md#pi_direction).

## A member's config

Opened on a Project's member, the editor fills the global settings from `project.yaml`,
marks them read-only with a banner, and writes only `dfms:` — see
[Projects and members](concepts-project.md). Any save keeps the keys the editor does not
show, `scripts:` above all, as they were.

## Things worth knowing

**Old configurations migrate on save.** Configurations written before pyflic split
Experiment Type from Chamber Layout still open: `experiment_type: two_well` opens as a
Custom Experiment with that layout, and saving migrates it.

**Exclusions do not live here.** `excluded_chambers` in YAML is ignored at load
time. Chamber exclusions belong in `remove_chambers.csv` — see
[exclusions](config-dfms-chambers.md#excluding-chambers).

## After saving

Validate:

```bash
pyflic lint my_experiment/
```

or use **Lint / migration check** on the Hub's Tools panel. The editor produces valid YAML,
but the linter also catches things it cannot know — a DFM with no matching CSV, a stale key
from an older version of pyflic.

If the Hub already has this member loaded, load it again — double-click its row in the
Project panel — to pick up your changes.
