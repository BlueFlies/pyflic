# Light state and phase analysis

Feeding in *Drosophila* is strongly rhythmic, so when a fly ate is often as interesting as
how much. If your rig recorded light state, pyflic can split every metric by light phase.

## Where light state comes from

If a DFM's CSV contains an **`OptoCol1`** column — and optionally **`OptoCol2`** — pyflic
decodes the per-well light on/off state from those bit-encoded values and stores it
alongside the signal. `OptoCol1` is a snapshot, taken five times a second: a light that came
on and went off between two snapshots is not in it.

A recording from DFM firmware 4.0.0 also carries **`OnMs`** for every well: how many of the
record's 200 milliseconds its LED was on, from any cause. pyflic uses it wherever it exists,
because it is exact. See [Generations](concepts-optogenetics.md#generations).

No `OptoCol1` column means no light information. Nothing fails; the light-phase features
simply have nothing to report and the light columns read zero. If you expected light data
and see none, check that your rig was configured to record it — pyflic cannot infer light
state from the feeding signal.

## What it is used for

**Light-on markers.** The single-chamber cumulative-licks plot,
`exp.plot_cumulative_licks_chamber(dfm_id, chamber)` in [Python](python-api.md#working-with-an-experiment),
marks every sample where a well's light was on with a gold diamond, so you can see feeding
bouts in relation to the light without cross-referencing a separate file.

**Light-phase summary.** An analysis that splits each chamber's activity into light and
dark phases and reports metrics for each. The
[script action](scripts-actions.md#analyse-actions) `light_phase_summary` writes it to
`analysis/light_phase_summary.csv`, with these columns:

```
DFM, Chamber, Treatment, Phase (light/dark), PhaseSeconds, Licks, Events, ...
```

Two-well chambers have `LicksA`, `LicksB`, `EventsA` and `EventsB` instead, the design
factors follow, and `Licks` is transformed as in the feeding summary.

**The phase is each chamber's own.** A sample is *light* for a chamber when one of its own
wells is lit: its `OptoCol1` bit, or on a firmware 4.0.0 recording its `OnMs` above zero.
Light a well receives through its linkage group counts, because the fly sees it. Until
firmware 4.0.0 support the phase was the whole DFM's: any lit LED put every chamber of the
DFM in *light*. On a recording whose chambers were lit at different times the numbers
change, and they are now the right ones.

`PhaseSeconds` is what makes the rest comparable. Light and dark phases are rarely equal
in length across a recording — a run that starts mid-afternoon has an unequal first
phase — so raw counts per phase are not comparable until you normalise by the time spent
in each. Divide by `PhaseSeconds` before comparing phases, or you will report a difference
that is really just a difference in exposure.

**Per-well light-on seconds.** The feeding summary carries `OptoOn_sec` for each chamber
(`OptoOn_sec_A` and `OptoOn_sec_B` for two-well chambers), giving the total time the light
was on for that well. On a firmware 4.0.0 recording it is the sum of `OnMs`; before, it
counts the lit `OptoCol1` snapshots, one sample period each. `summary.txt` says which, per
DFM, under *light seconds from*.

## Optogenetics

The same columns carry optogenetic stimulation state, which is why they are named `Opto`.
If you drive a channelrhodopsin with the FLIC's light output, the light-phase split
becomes a stimulation-on versus stimulation-off comparison, and everything above applies
unchanged.

An experiment with light in these columns also gets the **optogenetic light QC**, which
checks that the light was where the licks were and reads the MCU's `Program.txt` for the
thresholds, linkage and Paradigms behind it, and the **light table**, which says what each
chamber's light did. Its feeding-summary rows gain `Role`, `LitSec` and `Activations`. See
[Optogenetic experiments and the light QC](concepts-optogenetics.md).
