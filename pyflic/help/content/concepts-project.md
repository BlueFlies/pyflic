# Projects and members

pyflic has three structural levels, each recognised by a marker file:

| Level | Marker | Its children are | Found by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Batch** | none (structural) | Projects | a recursive walk that stops at each Project |
| **Project** | `project.yaml` | Members | its *immediate* subdirectories |
| **Experiment Directory** | `flic_config.yaml` | — | — |

Projects may sit at any depth *below the batch folder*, because grouping folders like
`Sept2026/` are transparent to the scan — but a Project's own members are its immediate
children and nothing deeper. See
[Running many projects at once](scripts-batch.md).

An **Experiment Directory** is one FLIC recording. A **Member** is an Experiment
Directory inside a Project. If you are working on a single recording with no siblings, you
never need a Project at all — open the Experiment Directory directly.

## Members are not replicates

A Project's members are **different experiments that address one question** — a dose
series, a genotype panel, a pilot beside its follow-up — not repeats of one another. That
is the difference from the sister application PyTrackingAnalysis, whose projects hold
replicates.

It matters in two places. The Design still forces one detection rule across every member,
because comparing them otherwise would be meaningless. But the Combined Analysis keeps
`Experiment` as a column and the mixed model nests DFM *within* Experiment, because the
rows are not interchangeable: DFM 1 in one member is a different physical device from DFM 1
in another, and the members themselves are different experiments.

## The design is an authority

The `design:` section of `project.yaml` owns **every** key under a member's `global:` —
the experiment type and chamber layout, the detection parameters, `well_names`,
`transform_licks`, the `constants:` cutoffs, the design factors, the Facets
(`facet_cutoffs`, `facet_labels`, `facet_source`), `optogenetics`, the exclusion groups
(`exclusion_group`, `also_exclude`), the [Slices](concepts-slices.md) (`slices`,
`slice_tolerance_min`), the `control_level`, and the Selection (`omit:`) that the QC,
Analyze and Plots panels'
ticks write (see [The ticks are configuration](app-hub.md#the-ticks-are-configuration)).

A member that contradicts any of them, or states a `global:` key the design does not own,
**fails to load**. This is stricter than it might
seem necessary, and deliberately so: if `well_names` says well A is S5 in one member and
S5Y5 in another, a pooled licks figure is not noisy, it is *wrong*, and nothing in the
output would show it.

```yaml
# project.yaml
name: drug_trial
design:
  global:
    experiment_type: Hedonic
    transform_licks: false
    facet_cutoffs: [60]
    params:
      feeding_threshold: 20
      samples_per_second: 5
    well_names: {A: S5, B: S5Y5}
    experimental_design_factors:
      TreatmentNew: [Ctrl, Exp]
```

## Writing the design

**Project panel → Project design…** is the editor for `project.yaml` — the Project's name,
its notes, and the whole design. **Create project…** and **Initialize existing directory…** open
the same editor, so a Project states its design when it is created rather than acquiring
one later by accident.

Three ways in, because a folder can be in three states: it already has a `project.yaml`
(**Open Project**), it does not exist yet (**Create project…**), or it exists without one
(**Initialize existing directory…**). Each refuses the other two's case rather than guessing.

The button reads **Project design… (none set)** for a Project with no `design:` block. Such
a Project still loads, but it validates its members against *each other* instead of against
an authority: whichever member happens to be first becomes the standard, silently, and
editing that member moves the standard. Writing a design fixes the rule in one place.

Opening the editor on a folder that is not a Project yet reads the design off the first
member it finds, which is the migration path — a folder of standalone experiments becomes a
Project without retyping what they already agree on.

Saving writes `project.yaml`. When the design's type is one of your lab's, saving also
writes its copy, `experiment_type.yaml`, beside it, and a new Project starts its
`plot_specs.yaml` with the type's own Plot Specs; choosing a shipped type removes the copy
(see [Where types live](concepts-experiment-types.md#where-types-live)).

### The Project design dialog

One dialog, titled *New Project*, *Edit Project design* or *Initialize existing directory*
by what it is doing, with four cards:

- **Project** — the **Directory** (its **Browse…** can make a new folder; an existing
  Project's design fills the form once you finish typing the path or pick it), the **Project
  name** (the folder's name by default, and fixed when initializing in place) and
  **Notes**, shown near the top of the Project Report.
- **Design** — what every member inherits: the **Experiment type**, with **New type…** to
  build one in the [Experiment Type Editor](app-type-editor.md) and, when the Project's copy
  of a lab type differs from the library's, **Update the copy from the library**; the
  **Chamber layout** (fixed by a type that owns it); **Well A** and **Well B**; **Transform
  licks**; **Optogenetics** (auto, yes or no); the **Facet source**, **Facet cutoffs** and
  **Phase names** ([Facets](concepts-facets.md)); the **Exclusion group** every member's
  `remove_chambers.csv` is read under, and **Also exclude**, the groups the whole recording
  also leaves out ([Exclusions](concepts-slices.md#exclusions)); the **Control level**, for
  a type with a [Treatment control](concepts-experiment-types.md#control-comparisons); and
  the **Design factors**.
- **Slices**: the [Slices](concepts-slices.md#slices-in-the-design) every member runs,
  one row each. A row gives the name, the start and end minute (`end`, or blank, for the end
  of the recording), the Slice's own exclusion group (its name unless you change it), the groups it also
  excludes, and the auto-removal cutoffs it overrides (blank keeps the design's). Below the
  rows is the **Coverage tolerance** ([Coverage](concepts-slices.md#coverage)). A Slice that
  cannot be used stops the save, and the dialog lists why. For a type with the Ratio
  analysis the card is greyed out with the reason, since such a type has no Slices.
- **Detection parameters** — the [detection parameters](reference-parameters.md), one rule
  for every member; the **Auto-filter thresholds**, each with a **Use** box (unticked turns
  that filter off; ticked and blank takes the type's default); for a type with the
  Progressive Ratio module, the **Progressive ratio light QC** and **Progressive ratio
  breaking point** groups ([Light QC](concepts-progressive-ratio.md#light-qc),
  [Breaking point](concepts-progressive-ratio.md#breaking-point)); and, unless
  Optogenetics is *no*, the **Optogenetic light QC** thresholds
  ([Thresholds](concepts-optogenetics.md#thresholds)).

Pointed at an Experiment Directory, *Initialize existing directory* offers to initialize
its parent instead, so the experiment becomes one of its members.

When you save a design, any member carrying a `global:` block of its own is listed and you
are offered the one repair there is: **delete those blocks so the members inherit**. Their
`dfms:` and `scripts:` are left untouched. A member that merely duplicates the design is
duplicating an authority; one that contradicts it stops the Project loading at all.

## Members inherit, they do not repeat

Because the design owns all of `global:`, a member's `flic_config.yaml` normally holds
only the parts that genuinely differ — its `dfms:` block and its own `scripts:`:

```yaml
# rep1/flic_config.yaml
dfms:
  - id: 1
    params: {pi_direction: left}
    chambers: {1: Ctrl, 2: Ctrl, 3: Exp}
```

If a `global:` block *is* present — typically a standalone experiment moved into a Project —
it is validated key by key, and any deviation is an error. The trade-off is that a
member's config is no longer readable on its own; you need its parent to know what it
means.

That is why the **config editor** reads the parent's design when you open a member's
config. The global settings are filled in from the design and shown **read-only**, with a
banner naming the `project.yaml` they came from, and the per-DFM override checkboxes are
limited to the physical keys. Saving writes `dfms:` (and leaves `scripts:` alone) without
a `global:` block at all — a member's config cannot be turned into a design violation by
editing it. A standalone experiment, governed by nothing, keeps every field editable.

## What stays free

- the whole `dfms:` block — DFM count, chamber → treatment assignment, and a DFM's own
  keys such as `paired_chambers`, `chamber_groups` and `optogenetics` (whether that DFM's
  lid was lit is a fact about the recording)
- per-DFM `params:` overrides, but **only** the physical keys `pi_direction` and
  `chamber_sets`

`pi_direction` genuinely varies between DFMs of one recording — it says which side of the
chamber the reference well sits on. An override of an *analysis* key is rejected inside a
Project, because it would reintroduce the divergence the design outlaws, one level lower
and much harder to see.

## Blocked members

A folder inside a Project can hold a perfectly good recording and still be unusable. The
loader reads `experiment_dir/data` and nothing else, so DFM CSVs sitting at the folder's
root are invisible — not broken, not warned about, simply absent from the Project.

The Project panel lists these as **blocked members**, in red, with the reason in the
tooltip, and the Batch panel counts them for each Project:

| Reason | Fix |
|---|---|
| `unfiled recording` — DFM CSVs at the root, not in `data/` | **File unfiled recordings** |
| `no config` — `data/` holds DFM CSVs but there is no `flic_config.yaml` | **Member configs…** or **Initialize existing directory…** |
| `no recording` — a config, but no DFM CSV the loader can find (a CSV whose name is spelled in the wrong case is named) | by hand |
| `ambiguous` — the same DFM id both loose and in `data/`, or a `data` that is a file | by hand: decide which copy is the experiment |
| `unreadable` — the folder cannot be listed (permissions?) | by hand |

Double-click a blocked row for its repair in place. In the Batch panel, right-click a
Project for **Fix blocked members in …**, which opens the
[review window](scripts-batch.md#the-review-window) on it.

Blocked belongs to the **member**, never to the Project: a Project with four healthy
members and one blocked one analyses the four.

**Filing** moves `DFM*.csv` into `data/`, with the `Program.txt` and `Messages.csv`
PyMCU exported beside them, since pyflic reads both only from `data/`. Every other loose
file goes into `extra_files/`. Every `.yaml` file and any `remove_chambers.csv` stays
exactly where it is — at a member root those are configuration and declaration, never
data. Nothing is ever overwritten.

## Adding a member

The same three cases, one level down — **Create member…** when it does not exist yet,
**Initialize existing directory…** when the folder is there but its config is not, and
**Member configs…** for doing the second in bulk. Double-clicking a blocked row offers the
same repair in place.

Right after **Create member…** the Hub asks how to finish the config: **Edit config…**
opens the scaffold, or **Copy config from…** replaces it with a config from a member that
already works — the common case for the second and later members of a run. A copy is
**checked against the design before it is written**, using the same test every member
passes at load. That ordering is the point: a non-conforming member makes the whole Project
refuse to load, and you would otherwise have to find and undo the copy by hand. A copy that
conforms is still not necessarily *ready* — it carries the other member's chamber
assignments, which are about that plate.

**Initialize existing directory…** files what is loose before it configures anything: the DFM
CSVs into `data/`, everything else into `extra_files/`. A config written first would
describe a member whose data the loader cannot see.

Scaffolding copies the `dfms:` block from the first existing member — members of one
design almost always reuse the plate layout, and retyping forty-eight chamber assignments is
the work worth avoiding — then reconciles it against the DFM ids actually in `data/`:

- an id in the data with no entry is **added**, chambers unassigned
- an entry with no data is **flagged**, never silently dropped, because a missing CSV is
  usually a copy that has not finished

An existing config is never overwritten.

If the folder's DFM CSVs are still loose at its root, file them first — scaffolding
reconciles against what is in `data/`, and doing it beforehand would write a config
reconciled against nothing.

### The Member configs dialog

**Member configs…** lists every folder of the Project that holds a recording or a config,
with whether it has a `flic_config.yaml`; a blocked one is red, with its reason in the
tooltip.

- **Create config** scaffolds the selected folder's config as described above, filing a
  loose recording first.
- **Create n missing config(s)** does the same for every folder that has none.
- **Edit config…** opens a configured folder's config in the Config Editor.

Double-clicking a row does whichever applies. Every note the scaffolding makes — a DFM
added with chambers unassigned, one kept and flagged — goes to the Hub's log, because each
is something to finish by hand. The Batch Run's review window hands a member whose reason
is `no config` to the same dialog.
