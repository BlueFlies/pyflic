"""The Activation ledger: one row per Activation, timed to the millisecond.

Firmware 4.0.0 records, per Well and per 200 ms record, how many milliseconds
the LED was lit (``OnMs``, after Linkage) and how many Activations the Well's
own Paradigm has counted.  An Activation is counted in the record where its
light starts, so that record's ``OnMs`` says how long before the record's
end the light came on; the last record of the light period says, the same
way, how long after its start it went out.  The ledger reads each
Activation's onset, end and lit time from those edges
(``docs/paradigm-analyses-plan.md``, decision 4 and contract C3).

Every family check and summary of the Paradigm analyses aggregates this
table; nothing downstream re-reads the rows.  The columns are
:data:`LEDGER_COLUMNS`:

* ``Well``, ``Row``, ``EndRow``, ``Index``, ``OnsetMin``: the Well (1-12),
  the row its Activation was counted on, the light period's last row
  (inclusive), the record's ``Index`` and pyflic's ``Minutes`` at ``Row``.
* ``OnsetMs``, ``EndMs``, ``LitMs``: the light period in milliseconds from
  the start of the record with ``Index`` 1, the time base of the simulator's
  and PyMCU's truth.  pyflic's ``Minutes`` count from the first row's time
  stamp instead, a sub-second offset away, so ``OnsetMin`` is never derived
  from ``OnsetMs``.
* ``Timing``: :data:`TIMING_EXACT` when the period's edge records fix both
  ends to the millisecond, else :data:`TIMING_RECORD` (good to one record).
* ``Overlap``: the period's length cannot be the Activation's own, because
  other light merges with it: a linked partner's, light already on, or the
  Well's next Activation.  Checks skip these rows.
* ``Boundary``: why the period stopped other than by the rule:
  :data:`BOUNDARY_GAP`, :data:`BOUNDARY_INTERVAL` or :data:`BOUNDARY_END`;
  :data:`BOUNDARY_NONE` (empty) otherwise.
* ``SinceLastOnsetMs``: from the same Well's previous onset in the same
  Paradigm-state run (``ParadigmState.state_runs``), any Phase.
* ``Phase``, ``K``: ``A`` or ``M`` at ``Row``, and the Activation's number
  among the Well's Phase-``M`` Activations of its state run (``NA`` in
  ``A``).  Under a ratio Paradigm the k-th Main Activation meets
  ``requirement_for(k)``.  A restart starts a new run, so ``K`` starts over
  after one, as the firmware's Requirement series does.  Two edges, where a
  record holds two states:

  - the row where a Well leaves Acclimation under a ratio Paradigm reads
    ``M``, but its Activations are Acclimation ones unless the Requirement
    advanced there (only a Main Activation advances it), and then only the
    row's last is Main, as ``ParadigmState.requirement_met`` reads that row;
  - the first row of a state run shows the new Paradigm, but an
    instruction that arrives within a record leaves the record's start to
    the old one, so an Activation counted there may be the old run's.  The
    rows cannot say which (``requirement_met`` shows no Requirement there),
    and the ledger counts it in the new run.
* ``Paradigm``, ``ProgramInterval``, ``Cycle``: at ``Row``.
* ``RequirementMet``: ``ParadigmState.requirement_met``.  The first row of a
  new Paradigm shows none; filling it from the program is the consumer's job.

Pure numpy and pandas over a :class:`~pyflic.base.paradigm_state.ParadigmState`:
no program, no pyflic feeding events and no Qt.  ``EndedBy``, which needs the
program's settings and pyflic's contact, is stream S1's (contract C4).
