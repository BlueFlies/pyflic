"""The Progressive Ratio experiment: paired/yoked Chamber Groups, data-derived
Training/Test Facets, and the within-group difference (ADR-0013).

Vocabulary is fixed in ``CONTEXT.md`` under *Progressive Ratio*:

* a **Chamber Group** is the chambers of one light circuit, sharing one
  Treatment and one training end: a pair (1+2, 3+4, 5+6, or as Program.txt's
  Linkage makes them), or a **solo** group of one chamber with no yoked
  control (decision 13 of ``docs/paradigm-analyses-plan.md``;
  :func:`~pyflic.base.experiment_types.progressive_ratio.resolve_chamber_groups`);
* the **Paired** chamber's feeding at the **Sucrose Well** (always well A)
  drives the light; the **Yoked** chamber is lit at the same moments;
* **Training** ends, per group, at the paired chamber's Sucrose Well's
  training end; the **Test** phase is everything after.

How a recording says where Training ends depends on its **Generation**
(``CONTEXT.md``; ``docs/v4-data-plan.md``, decisions 11-15):

* generation 1: the last minute the firmware flags the Sucrose Well in
  training (raw sample > 40000); a Light Event is an onset of the chamber's
  ``OptoCol1`` light, the OR of its two wells' bits (the data sets all four
  bits of a group together);
* generation 2 (a DFM older than firmware 4.0.0 recorded by PyMCU 4.0.0):
  nowhere.  Each group has one Facet, ``Recording``, ``TrainingComplete`` is
  NA, and there is no Test phase, Breaking Point or Sucrose Persistence;
* generation 3: the Sucrose Well's first row in Phase ``M`` under a ratio
  Paradigm.  A Light Event is the Sucrose Well's own **Activation**, which
  carries the Requirement it met and the Firmware Events it took, light
  seconds come from ``OnMs``, and the Test window ends where the ratio
  Paradigm's run ends.

Everything here is derived from the ordinary two-well machinery plus the
Chamber Groups: ``Program.txt``'s Linkage, or one config key per DFM,
``paired_chambers`` (or ``chamber_groups: single``).  The paired-minus-yoked
parts skip a solo group, and the report says so once.

A DFM that restarts on its own inside a group's Test window ends that
window: the ratio starts again after a restart, so the Breaking Point is
judged up to it, censored when the fly was still responding there
(decision 15).
