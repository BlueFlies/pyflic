"""The light QC's rule subsections: each Paradigm's rule checks, and its rule figure.

Stream S3 of ``docs/paradigm-analyses-plan.md``.  On a firmware 4.0.0
recording (generation 3) with a ``Program.txt``, the report's *Optogenetic
light QC* gains one subsection per Paradigm the member's program runs, in
:data:`~pyflic.base.paradigm_families.FAMILY_ORDER`, then by Paradigm name
(:func:`rule_sections`, :func:`report_blocks`).  Each has:

* the rule in words, with its settings (:func:`paradigm_families.rule_sentence
  <pyflic.base.paradigm_families.rule_sentence>`);
* a table of its family's light-QC columns per Linkage Group that ran it,
  with the Activations judged and not judged and the verdict;
* one figure, one panel per DFM, that puts the measured light against the
  rule's setting:

  ======================  ====================================================
  Family (figure)         What it draws
  ======================  ====================================================
  closed loop             a histogram of the judged Activations' lit time
  (activation_length)     (``LitMs``), dashed at the Hold and at ``MaxOnMs``
  fixed length, interval  a histogram of the time between consecutive Main
  (onset_spacing)         onsets (``SinceLastOnsetMs``), dashed at
                          max(``LockoutMs``, ``ActivationMs``), and beside it
                          the lit time, dashed at ``ActivationMs``
  fixed length, ratio     the Requirement each Main Activation met against its
  (requirement_series)    number K, over the line of ``requirement_for(k)``,
                          and beside it the lit time, dashed at
                          ``ActivationMs``
  non-feeding             a histogram of each Activation's relight delay
  (relight_delay)         (:func:`rule_checks.relight_delays
                          <pyflic.base.rule_checks.relight_delays>`), dashed at
                          ``OnDelayMs``; with ``MaxOnMs``, beside it the lit
                          time, dashed there
  open loop               none: the Program timeline shows the schedule
  ======================  ====================================================

  Light that breaks the rule is drawn in the failure colour, as bars and as a
  rug of ticks under the axis, so that one failing Activation among hundreds
  still shows.  A section with nothing judged gets a
  :class:`report_layout.NothingToDraw <pyflic.base.report_layout.NothingToDraw>`
  note instead.

A Paradigm with Acclimation has two subsections: its Acclimation, under
closed loop, and its Main, under its own family, so a section appears exactly
when its family is in the program (:func:`paradigm_families.families_in
<pyflic.base.paradigm_families.families_in>`).  Wells set ``On`` under
another Paradigm are open loop: one section of their own.  A Program
Interval beyond the lines ``Program.txt`` prints (a Repeating program's
later passes, the rest of a Circadian day) is judged by its Paradigm by
name, as the light QC judges it.

**The numbers are the light QC's.**  The checks are stream S1's
(:mod:`pyflic.base.rule_checks`), made with the inputs the light QC gives
them (``opto_qc``'s windows, each group's mode and Trigger Wells in them and
the Paradigm starts, read through its helpers; the Activation ledger with
the program's Linkage, whose rows ``opto_light_events.csv`` carries), but on
one Paradigm of one Linkage Group at a time.  So the checks' columns, summed
over a group's sections, are its ``opto_light_qc.csv`` values, and a group
that ran two Paradigms of a family shows each apart.  The per-Activation
marks the figures draw (:func:`mark_activations`) use the checks' own rules,
and add up to their counts.
