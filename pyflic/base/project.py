"""Project: a marker-file parent of member Experiment Directories (ADR-0005).

A directory with a ``project.yaml`` is a Project; its immediate subdirectories
containing a ``flic_config.yaml`` are its **Members**.  The Project owns the
Combined Analysis (stacked *filtered* per-member summaries with an
``Experiment`` column, pooled tests beside a mixed model), the project-level
``plot_specs.yaml`` / ``figures/``, and the Project Report.

Two things here differ deliberately from PyTrackingAnalysis:

* The ``design:`` section is the authority for **every** key under a Member's
  ``global:``, not just the type and the design factors.  ``well_names`` and
  ``transform_licks`` divergence produces a pooled figure that is *wrong* rather
  than merely noisy, and no shorter list had a defensible boundary.
* A Member normally **omits** ``global:`` and inherits it, so that authority
  costs no duplication.  A ``global:`` that is present is validated key by key.

The Design may declare **Slices** (ADR-0020): separate analyses of part of
every Member's recording.  :meth:`Project.for_slice` gives the same Project
seen through one Slice — its Members' outputs read from ``slices/<name>/``,
its own written to ``<project>/slices/<name>/`` — and a Slice's Combined
Analysis pools only the Members whose recording covers it.
