"""The ``ExperimentType`` (ADR-0007, ADR-0019).

An Experiment Type is a reusable definition of an assay's shape that selects
a **Chamber Layout** and constrains the rest of an experiment — the required
``well_names``, the facet cutoffs and phase labels, the default
``constants:``, the light it expects, the **Analysis Modules** that run, the
Plot Specs of its report, and the report produced.  It is a *composed
strategy object*, not an ``Experiment`` subclass: the subclass hierarchy
stays where it belongs, one level down, expressing the data shape, and a
module that carries maths of its own names its subclass.

Since ADR-0019 a type is data: one instance of this class built from a
:class:`~pyflic.base.experiment_types.definition.TypeDefinition` — a
shipped one (Custom, Hedonic, ProgressiveRatio) or a lab's own — whose
modules supply the behaviour that used to be subclass code.  Per ADR-0007 a
type **owns** its fixed fields — a typed ``flic_config.yaml`` omits
``chamber_layout`` and ``params.chamber_size`` and they are derived here,
never written to disk.  Built from no definition, the class is the
permissive default.
