"""The rule checks: each Paradigm checked against its own rule, one Activation at a time.

Firmware 4.0.0 records every Activation and its light to the millisecond
(:mod:`pyflic.base.activation_ledger`), and DFMV3_V2's ``LEDControl.c`` keeps
each Paradigm type's rule exactly.  So a light period that breaks the rule
of the Paradigm ``Program.txt`` names means the file is not the program that
ran, or the LED or its report is faulty (``docs/paradigm-analyses-plan.md``,
stream S1 and decisions 5 to 7; ADR-0015's last addendum).

One function per check.  Each reads the ledger rows of a Linkage Group's
Trigger Wells under one Paradigm (:data:`~pyflic.base.activation_ledger.LEDGER_COLUMNS`),
the Paradigm's settings and, where the rule turns on contact, pyflic's
activity at the well, and returns a :class:`CheckResult`: the count that is
its column in ``opto_light_qc.csv``, how many it could judge, whether its flag
fires and the reason in words, naming the setting and the value measured.

**Judgeable.**  A row is judgeable for a length when it is not ``Overlap``
and its ``Boundary`` is empty (:func:`judgeable`); the rest are counted as
not judged.  ``tol`` is ``opto_activation_tolerance_ms``; a row whose
``Timing`` is ``record`` is good to one record only, so its tolerance widens
by one (:func:`tolerances`).
