"""The light table: what each well's light did, in the feeding summary's shape.

Every optogenetic experiment, of any Experiment Type, gets one (decisions 6
and 16 of ``docs/v4-data-plan.md``): ``analysis/light_wells.csv``, one row
per well, and ``analysis/light_summary.csv``, one row per chamber, for every
DFM the optogenetic light QC covers, over the chambers the design assigns a
Treatment (the feeding summary's rows, after auto-removal).  They carry the
feeding summary's Treatment and design-factor columns, so the Combined
Analysis, the reports and the Plot Editor pool and test light behaviour as
they do feeding.  The columns tested between treatments are the headline
metrics of the Paradigm Families the member's program runs
(:func:`experiment_headline_metrics`, decision 9 of
``docs/paradigm-analyses-plan.md``); :data:`HEADLINE_METRICS`, the fixed four
of before, stays for a member without a generation-3 recording.

What a row can say depends on the recording's **Generation** (``CONTEXT.md``):

* **Generation 3** reads the firmware's own decisions from
  :attr:`DFM.paradigm <pyflic.base.dfm.DFM.paradigm>`: lit time exact from
  ``OnMs``, Activations, Acclimation (Phase ``A``), Firmware Events and the
  Requirements met under a ratio Paradigm, and the Paradigm, Program
  Interval and Cycle each row was recorded under.
* **Generations 1 and 2** have only ``OptoCol1``, the LEDs sampled once a
  record: ``LitSec`` counts the lit samples (``LitSource`` says which), and
  every firmware column is ``NA``.  ``LightOnsets``, the rising edges of a
  well's own light, is there on every generation: on generation 1 it is the
  nearest thing to an Activation count.  With a program, the Paradigm, its
  type and the Program Interval come from the program's clock schedule
  (approximate, as the generation-1 light QC's windows are).

The Paradigm **type** comes from ``Program.txt``: without the DFM's section
``ParadigmType`` and every type-specific column are ``NA`` (decision 4), and
a type-specific column is ``NA`` wherever the well ran no Paradigm of a type
that defines it:

* Acclimation columns: FixedInterval and the ratio types, with Acclimation;
* ``FirmwareEvents``, ``LastRequirementMet``, ``ProgressAtEnd``,
  ``EventsPerActivation``: the ratio types (ProgressiveRatio, FixedRatio);
* ``UnlitSec``: NonFeeding.

The Paradigm Families' own columns (stream S2 of
``docs/paradigm-analyses-plan.md``, decisions 8, 10 and 11) are read from
the Activation ledger (:mod:`pyflic.base.activation_ledger`), on generation 3
with a program only, each ``NA`` outside its family.  An Activation belongs
to the window holding its onset row; one is *judgeable* when it is not
``Overlap`` and has no ``Boundary``, and ``tol`` is
``opto_activation_tolerance_ms`` (:func:`activation_tolerance_ms`), one
record wider for an Activation timed to the record:

* closed loop (ClosedLoop, and any Phase-``A`` Activation):
  ``MedianActivationSec``, the median ``LitMs`` of its judgeable
  Activations; ``CutOffs`` (ClosedLoop with ``MaxOnMs``), the judgeable ones
  within ``tol`` of ``MaxOnMs``;
* ``MainActivations`` (any Paradigm with Acclimation): the Phase-``M``
  Activations;
* FixedInterval: ``MaxActivations``, its Main time divided by
  max(``LockoutMs``, ``ActivationMs``), floored; ``RewardEfficiency``, its
  Main Activations divided by that; ``MedianReturnSec``, the median of
  ``SinceLastOnsetMs`` less that spacing between consecutive Main
  Activations; ``LockedOutContactSec`` (redefined, decision 10), pyflic's
  lick time in its Main rows while its own lockout runs (``LockoutMs`` from
  an onset) and its own Activation is not lit (``ActivationMs`` from it),
  so a linked partner's light no longer hides it;
* NonFeeding: ``Suppressions`` (redefined, decision 10), the judgeable
  Activations not ended by ``MaxOnMs``, since contact is the only other way
  the light goes out; ``MedianSuppressionSec``, the median dark time from a
  suppression to the next Activation of its state run;
* open loop (decision 11; the chamber's Role is Open, or in the window its
  wells run open loop and nothing else): ``LicksPerMinLit`` and
  ``LicksPerMinDark``, the licks while the chamber's own light is on and
  off per minute of each (:func:`analytics.chamber_light_phases
  <pyflic.base.analytics.chamber_light_phases>`, which
  ``light_phase_summary`` reports), and ``LightFeedingIndex``, (lit - dark)
  / (lit + dark) of the two, ``NA`` when either phase is absent or both
  rates are 0.

A window is the feeding summary's: one ``(a, b]`` range of minutes
(``(0, 0)`` the whole recording), or a list of them, as a Program Facet
pooling a Repeating program's Cycles has.  ``Paradigm``, ``ParadigmType``,
``ProgramInterval`` and ``Cycle`` hold the one value of the window, or
``mixed``; the baseline (Program Interval 0) and the rows of an unknown
instruction are left out of them (decision 30).

``Role`` is the chamber's (:mod:`pyflic.base.opto_roles`), except where the
Experiment Type assigns its own (Progressive Ratio's paired / yoked), which
it keeps everywhere.  :func:`with_light_columns` puts ``Role``, ``LitSec``
and ``Activations`` on the feeding summary's rows.
